Working with spatial trajectories using Boost.Geometry

This repo contains example code and slides for the FOSDEM2020 talk "Working with spatial trajectories in Boost Geometry".

To compile the examples you need [Boost.Geometry](https://github.com/boostorg/geometry) and [GeoLife trajectories dataset](https://download.microsoft.com/download/F/4/8/F4894AA5-FDBC-481E-9285-D5F8C4C4F039/Geolife%20Trajectories%201.3.zip)
